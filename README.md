# Async-Await-and-Actors---Concurrency-in-Swift

- Concurrency allows multiple tasks to run at the same time. Understanding concurrency is an important part of iOS app development. When used correctly, it can create a pleasant user experience and can even avoid crashing your app. In this course, you will learn about the new concurrency features available in Swift using Async/Await and Actors.

- Async/Await and Actors are the future direction of concurrency in Swift and this course will teach you the concepts and practical uses of these modern features. After completing this course, you will be comfortable to add these new features in your applications.
